This project was created with Python Flask and Javascript, following a tutorial from the book "Flask: Building Python Web Services" by Gareth Dwyer, Shalabh Aggarwal, and Jack Stouffer.

## Crimemap: What it does
This application allows users to report instances of crimes on the street that they witness, and display the criminal history of a neighborhood on Google map.
Each submission of crime report includes specifying the location of the crime by clicking on the map, choosing the date on which the crime happened, and describing it.
The application can be of use for professional purpose to police force, for raising awareness to residents, or for research.
